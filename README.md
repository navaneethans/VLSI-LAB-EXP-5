SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

AIM: To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Xilinx ISE.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED: **

Xilinx 14.7 
Spartan6 FPGA

**PROCEDURE: **
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. 
STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. 
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. 
STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA
